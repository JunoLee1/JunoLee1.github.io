># description of the problem

Calculate the number of unique pathes~~~!!

># logic 

Leaving traces, which are `1`, and adding the number,  unwind `amount of unique pathes` of the robot which only moves `right` and `down`.
As I said earlier, we must add `1` whenever the robot moves. However, it is far more essential that there is a `condition` which is `m` or `n`, called length and width, is bigger than 1 to add `1`.
Let me solve by `formulation.`!!

f(m,n) =f(m-1,n) + f(m,n-1)

f(1,0) =f(0,1) + f(1,0) = 1

f(2,0) = f(1,0)+ f(2,0) = 1

f(3,2) = f(2,2)+ f(3,1)















```python

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m==1 and n==1:
            return 1
        if (m == 2 and n== 1) or (m == 1 and n ==2):
            return 1
        res=0
        if m>1:
            res+=self.uniquePaths(m-1,n)
        if n>1:
            res+=self.uniquePaths(m,n-1)
        return res


class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 1 or n == 1:
            return 1

        return self.uniquePaths(m - 1, n) + self.uniquePaths(m, n - 1)
